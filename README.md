# HelloWorldGo

## Background

I attended an excellent [Introduction to Go Workshop](https://www.bridgetroll.org/events/387) on Saturday, March 24, 2018. The class was both informative and enjoyable--to where I have decided to undertake the journey of learning this language.

In addition to being a traditional Hello World project, this is also my first use of the [JetBrains GoLand](https://www.jetbrains.com/go/) IDE. Additionally--and for a variety of reasons--I have never once pushed anything to my personal [GitHub](https://github.com) repo. Lastly, I would like to cultivate habitual documenting and checklisting as part of my own development process.

In satisfying these objectives, I realize this may appear to others as an exercise in overkill. However, that would be missing the point of this being a comprehensive, fun workout.
